# Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the risk of corporate bankruptcy using **structured financial data** and supervised machine learning techniques.

The objective is to model bankruptcy as a **practical risk assessment problem**, rather than optimizing purely for accuracy.

---

## What this project does
- Uses **financial ratios and company-level indicators** as input  
- Performs **data cleaning and feature engineering** on tabular data  
- Trains supervised ML models to predict bankruptcy risk  
- Evaluates models using standard classification metrics  
- Emphasizes **interpretability and business relevance**

---

## Problem context
Corporate bankruptcy prediction is important for:
- Financial risk assessment  
- Credit analysis  
- Early warning systems  

This project treats bankruptcy prediction as a **decision-support task**, not just a classification exercise.

---

## Approach (high level)
1. Prepare and clean financial data  
2. Engineer meaningful financial features  
3. Train supervised machine learning models  
4. Evaluate performance and stability  
5. Analyze results from a business-risk perspective  

---

## Model & Code
- Training and inference code are included in this repository  
- **Model artifacts are not stored here** due to size constraints  

📦 Trained model weights are hosted on Hugging Face:

## Notes
- Focus is on **tabular ML and feature-driven modeling**
- No deep learning is used
- Designed to be extended with additional financial indic
